# Welcome To My Github Homepage!



Hello and welcome to my homepage on Github!

My name is Daniel and I live in Jerusalem, Israel.

This Github account contains a rather eclectic mix of repositories so I thought I would write a little note to explain what's residing here. 

## Backup Related Material

As a longtime Linux and open source user, I learned the hard way that robust backup strategies are *essential* to protecting important data!

The various backup guides here are just documentation of how I *do* backups to protect my Linux OS.

Some repos sharing that:

- https://github.com/danielrosehill/UbuntuBackupStrategy

### Cloud/SaaS Backup

There aren't all that many sayings in IT that can be fairly described as "properly hackneyed" but "the cloud is just somebody else's computer" is probably one of them.

I try to make sure that anywhere I commit data to (including Github!) complies with the simple 3-2-1 backup yardstick (my interpretation: original + 2 copies, one of them offsite).

Consumer SaaS backup is highly under-developed. For that reason I've tried to document a few of the data export/liberation approaches offered by various services (they can't properly be described as "backup" engines).

These can be found here:

## Home Assistant 

I recently (at the time of writing) set up Home Assistant on my network. 

I'm very interested in using Home Assistant to create home automations based around the Jewish religious calendar, including the weekly observance of Shabbat. 

As I figure things out, I'll occasionally share them here:
